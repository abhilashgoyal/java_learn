This repository have basic codes which are done on day to day basis



1: Spirral_array.java
 
This code prints the array in spiral format:

input:5

output: 

	1      2      3      4      5

	16      17      18      19      6 

	15      24      25      20      7 

	14      23      22      21      8 

	13      12      11      10      9 

input: 4

output:

    1       2       3       4 

    12      13      14      5 

    11      16      15      6

    10      9       8      7


2: seive_prime.java

Uses the seive algorithm to print all the primes numbers upto a limit 'n' entered by the user.

3: min_dist_points.java 
Given a sequence of points and the order in which it is needed to cover the points. Find the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.
Eg: input: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3,3) ]
    output: 3
